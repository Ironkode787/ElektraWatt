# Backlog

Open work, one row each. A finished row is deleted; a new one is added under its milestone. The numbers are the
old follow-up numbers, kept so that a row's history can be found in git (`5516edba4`, `docs/plan/follow-ups.md`
and the work breakdown's Appendix B).

## M2.5-Fix: a properly working program

Fixes only. The gate is the owner's own hands-on test: the wizard, a new project, placing, wiring, routing, the
symbol editor and the QET import work without anything that stops the work. Its release is 0.2.0.

### The owner's hands-on test of 0.1.0-rc.3

- FT-1645 `ew-import-qet, ew-scene`: What an imported QET folio still shows differently, after the full-fidelity work of M2.5-Fix: a master's contact list has no contact symbols and its rows stand closer than QET's 10 px (the scene has no list drawing and the text style no line height); `displayhas="cross"` and `snapto="bottom"` cross-references print as a list, with a report entry; QET's folio list arrives as EW's own table of contents; an element's `mirror` is not read (QET 0.100 writes none; newer versions do); fonts are substituted, so texts sit slightly lower.

### Wiring and routing

- FT-1597 `golden`: On Golden A's folio 106 the wires to the modules' lower pins (4, 5, FE) wrap round the module bodies, because doc 20 §15 puts the interruption points of the top and bottom pins' feeds in one cell (B1, E1); give the lower-pin feeds cells of their own (below the modules) and route them without the wrap.

## Later

New development and polish for M3 and after, not scheduled: [backlog-later.md](backlog-later.md).
